# Task Tracker

Task Tracker is a simple task monitoring system for small teams or companies. It was originally developed in C as part of a university assignment, and later rewritten in Python for personal practice and learning.

## 📌 Project Versions

### ✅ C Version

The original version was built using the C programming language. It allows users to:

- Register multiple projects and tasks.
- Input weekly task statuses (Pending, In Progress, Completed).
- Track task completion over 12 weeks.
- Display the number of completed tasks per project.
- Identify the project with the highest and lowest completion percentages.
- Calculate overall progress for each project.

### 🐍 Python Version

The Python version replicates the core functionality of the C version, but with:
- Predefined task data for testing and demonstration.
- Simplified structure using lists and control flow.
